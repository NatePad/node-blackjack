# Node Blackjack

This is a Node CLI application that lets you play Blackjack! It uses concepts that we've covered so far in the Coding Bootcamp except for the [for of loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), which is my favorite way to iterate through an array.

## Installation

After cloning the repo to your machine and `cd`ing into the folder, first run the command `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies, then run either the `node .` or the `npm start` command to play Blackjack!
